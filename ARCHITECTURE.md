This document describes the high-level architecture of the fish build orchestration system.

## Overview

Fish is a cache-first, polyglot build orchestration system designed for monorepos and polyglot projects. It uses a dependency graph, parallel scheduler, executor, and CAS artifact cache to optimize build performance.

## Core Components

**Responsibilities**:
- Scan workspace for packages/projects
- Detect project types based on manifest files
- Filter input files by micro-globs (`MicroInputFilter`)

- Manage and isolate hermetic compiler toolchains (`ToolchainRegistry`, `ToolchainSpec`)
- Manage package metadata

**Key Types**:
- `Package`: Represents a single package/project
- `Workspace`: Collection of packages with dependencies

Fingerprint-based caching enables instant rebuilds when inputs haven't changed.

### 3. Parallel Execution

Tasks are executed in parallel respecting dependencies, maximizing CPU utilization.

### 4. Incremental Builds

Only rebuild affected packages based on dependency graph changes.

### 5. Distributed Execution

Remote workers enable horizontal scaling for large projects.

## Architecture Status

Fish is a single-language Rust workspace. There are no Python or Go services
in this repository, and no crate currently uses gRPC/protobuf. Earlier drafts
of this document described a "Tri-Engine" architecture; that description did
not match the codebase and has been removed.

### Current core (implemented)

- **`fish-core`**: Workspace discovery, manifest models, fine-grained input filtering.
- **`fish-graph`**: Dependency graph, topological sort, algebraic query evaluation (`deps`, `rdeps`, `somepath`).
- **`fish-executor`**: Process execution, middleware chain, response file generation.
- **`fish-scheduler`**: GNU Jobserver pool, work-stealing, parallel execution.
- **`fish-cache`**: Multi-tier fingerprinting with Blake3 and two-phase pruning.
- **`fish-cas`**: Content-addressable artifact storage with ZSTD compression.
- **`fish-cli`**: Terminal user interface powered by ratatui and clap.

### Planned: cross-language contracts (`proto/`)

The files under `proto/fish/v1/` (`build.proto`, `ai.proto`,
`coordinator.proto`) are forward-looking interface drafts only. They are not
compiled or referenced by any crate yet — the workspace has no `prost`/`tonic`
dependencies. Distributed features shipped today use plain HTTP/JSON instead
(see `crates/fish-worker` and `crates/fish-remote-cache`).

## Security Considerations

- No unsafe code in security-sensitive crates
- Input validation across all backends
- Least privilege for all operations
- Audit logging for security operations
- Secure secret management
- Ed25519 artifact signing and cryptographic SBOM generation
